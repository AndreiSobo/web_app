- **Firefox Responsive Design Mode**: Test responsive breakpoints
- **Real Devices**: Test on actual mobile devices when possible

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Portrait mode** on various mobile devices (iPhone, Android)
2. **Landscape mode** orientation changes
3. **Touch interactions** - tap, scroll, form filling
4. **Species auto-fill functionality** on mobile
5. **Classification process** from mobile devices

## üé® Design System

### Colors:
- Primary: #2196f3 (Blue)
- Success: #4caf50 (Green)

4. **Optimized media queries** - only load necessary styles

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

Consider these additional mobile improvements:
- **PWA features** (offline support, install prompt)
- **Swipe gestures** for species navigation
- **Voice input** for accessibility
- **Enhanced animations** with motion preferences
- **Dark mode** automatic detection and support

## üêß Mobile-Specific Features

### Species Reference Cards:
- **Mobile**: Single column, full-width cards
- **Tablet**: Two-column grid
- **Desktop**: Three-column grid

### Form Layout:
- **Mobile**: Stacked inputs with full width
- **Tablet**: Two-column layout
- **Desktop**: Maintains two-column with better spacing

### Button Behavior:
- **Touch feedback**: Visual and haptic responses
- **Loading states**: Clear progress indicators
- **Disabled states**: Prevent double-taps during processing

The mobile optimization ensures that users can effectively classify penguin species from any device, with particular attention to smartphone usability and touch interactions.
